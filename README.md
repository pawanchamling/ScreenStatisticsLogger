# ScreenStatisticsLogger

A simple android app to log screen ON and OFF states.
It helps to answer these questions
- How long was the screen OFF (before we turned it ON i.e. screen is ON now)? and when did we turned it OFF?
- How many times (count) the screen was turned ON(OFF) today?
- What is the total time duration the screen is/was ON today?
- What is the total time duration the screen was OFF today?
- How long has the screen been kept ON (now)?
- What is the total time duration the screen was kept ON the last time (not now but one time earlier)? And when was that?
